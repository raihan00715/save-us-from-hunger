            <h2> We are 100% non-profit Organization</h2>

            <p>All of our volunteers work willingly. Most of them are students of Universities, colleges even from
                schools.
                Each country has our branch office to maintain the work process of that country.

                <h3>Food for Homeless people</h3>
                <p>Volunteering to feed the homeless is truly an eye opening experience to what reality is. There is an
                    estimated one hundred million homeless people in the world who are starving and are trying to find a
                    way to survive. On a day-to-day basis, we see homeless people everywhere such as on the streets.</p>

                <h3>Food for Orphanage</h3>
                <p>Orphanages are always in need of the basic supplies, such as diapers, underwear, socks, shoes,
                    pajamas and other clothing. Some items that may be taken for granted seem like a luxury to children
                    in orphanages, such as televisions, radios, books, electronics and sports equipment..</p>

                <p>The street children live in the street They have no definite place or house to live in. They move
                    here and there on the streets, eat the leftover food from the roadside and sleep at night on the
                    footpaths, railway stations, bus stands, and launch ghats. A street child has no specific address to
                    live..</p>
